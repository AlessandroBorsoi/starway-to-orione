# Starway to Orione: the Orione Team Study Path

This is the study path every new dev has to follow when joins our team.

This path reflect our team's culture and values, which have its roots in the [agile values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/), as well as in those of XP, and in the [software craftsmanship manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).

Please feel free to fork and contribute, add materials, fix the existing ones and propose new stuff.

## Main study path
