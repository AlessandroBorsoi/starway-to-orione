# The Clean Code path

## Good Object-Oriented design principles and heuristics
1. Read the article ["Keep It DRY, Shy, and Tell the Other Guy"](http://media.pragprog.com/articles/may_04_oo1.pdf)
2. Tell Don't Ask principle
  * read the article ["Tell, Don't Ask"](http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask)
  * read the article ["The Art of Enbugging"](http://media.pragprog.com/articles/jan_03_enbug.pdf)

## Clean Code
1. Read chapters 1-10 of __"The Clean Code"__ book
2. View episodes 1-7 ("Fundamentals") of __"The Clean Coder"__ screencast series: http://cleancoders.com/category/fundamentals#videos

## Refactoring
["Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"](http://www.amazon.it/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672) by M.Fowler

1. Chapter 1. Refactoring, a First Example
2. Chapter 2. Principles in Refactoring
3. Exercises
 * Chapter 1: Re-play by yourself the example, starting from a codebase covered by tests.
 You may start from this code if you like:
     * [Ruby code](https://gist.github.com/xpepper/5308896)
     * [Java code](https://github.com/xpeppers/Refactoring-Chapter-1)
  * Answer to the following questions:
    * why should you refactor?
    * when should you refactor?
    * when and why you SHOULD NOT refactor?
    * what is the relation between refactoring and design?
4. Chapter 3. ("bad smells in code")
  * Write a blog post explaining what are, in your opinion, the 3 top smells, and why

## OO Analysis
["Applying UML and Patterns"](http://www.amazon.com/Applying-UML-Patterns-Introduction-Object-Oriented/dp/0131489062) (2nd ed.) by C.Larman.
1. Read cap.1 ("Object-Oriented Analysis and Design")
  * Try to estimate the time needed to study that chapter (using the pomodoro technique)
  * Answer (for example on the team's wiki pages)
    * What is analysis?
    * What is design?
    * What's the difference between them?
    * What is design for?
      * in other words, how would you reply to the following statement: _"I just need to understand what to do (analysis) and than do it (coding). Everything else does not matter!"_

## Testing and testability
### The Clean Code Talks series by [Miško Hevery](http://misko.hevery.com/)
These four videos (and the related blogpost series) are really valuable to learn how to design for testability.
1. Watch ["The Clean Code Talks -- Unit Testing" video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhu57pih5w) (~ 30 minutes) [[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mZsq0WljEfgIR9Df_IcW0VQfNl-Pk_cEBR3i9id-eR4/present#slide=id.i0)]. Then read [his blogpost](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/11/04/clean-code-talks-unit-testing/).
3. Watch ["The Clean Code Talks -- Inheritance, Polymorphism, & Testing" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F72VULWFvc) (~ 40 minutes). Then read [his blogpost](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/12/08/clean-code-talks-inheritance-polymorphism-testing/) (there you can find the slides too).
3. Watch ["The Clean Code Talks - Don't Look For Things!" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlfLCWKxHJ0) (~ 35 minutes) which talks about the Dependency Injection pattern. Then read [his blogpost](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/11/11/clean-code-talks-dependency-injection/) (there you can find the slides too).
4. Watch ["The Clean Code Talks - "Global State and Singletons" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FRm3VPhseI) (~ 55 minutes). Then read [his blogpost](http://misko.hevery.com/2008/11/21/clean-code-talks-global-state-and-singletons/) (there you can find the slides too).
5. For each video you see, write a short post (e.g. on your public [gist](https://gist.github.com/)) on
  * what you learn
  * what puzzled you most?
6. Read Miško Hevery's guide on ["Writing Testable Code"](http://misko.hevery.com/code-reviewers-guide/)
