#Sections
* The Pomodoro technique
* Object-Oriented Design and Principles
* SOLID principles
* UML basics
* Design Patterns
* Test Automation
* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Refactoring
* Learning Ruby and Rails

##Common starting path
* Read ["The Pomodoro Technique"](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) paper by F.Cirillo.

##Ruby path
1. Complete all the [Ruby koans](http://rubykoans.com/).
1. Read ["Eloquent Ruby"](http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321584104) - chapter 1-9 ("basics")

##Clean Code path
###Refactoring
["Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"](http://www.amazon.it/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672) by M.Fowler

1. Chapter 1. Refactoring, a First Example
1. Chapter 2. Principles in Refactoring
1. Exercises
 * Chapter 1: Re-play by yourself the example, starting from a codebase covered by tests.
 You may start from this code if you like:
     * Ruby: https://gist.github.com/xpepper/5308896
     * Java: https://github.com/xpeppers/Refactoring-Chapter-1
  * Answer to the following questions:
    * why should you refactor?
    * when should you refactor?
    * when and why you SHOULD NOT refactor?
    * what is the relation between refactoring and design?

###OO Analysis
["Applying UML and Patterns"](http://www.amazon.com/Applying-UML-Patterns-Introduction-Object-Oriented/dp/0131489062) (2nd ed.) by C.Larman.
* Read cap.1 ("Object-Oriented Analysis and Design")
  * Try to estimate the time needed to study that chapter (using the pomodoro technique)
  * Answer (for example on the team's wiki pages)
    * What is analysis?
    * What is design?
    * What's the difference between them?
    * What is design for?
      * in other words, how would you reply to the following statement: _"I just need to understand what to do (analysis) and than do it (coding). Everything else does not matter!"_

###Testing
* Watch "The Clean Code Talks -- Unit Testing" video from M.Havery: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhu57pih5w
* Write a post on 1) what you learn 2) what puzzled you most?

###Refactoring
["Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"](http://www.amazon.it/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672) by M.Fowler
1. Chapter 3. ("bad smells in code")
  * Write a blog post explaining what are, in your opinion, the 3 top smells, and why

###Good Object-Oriented design principles and heuristics
* Rad the article ["Keep It DRY, Shy, and Tell the Other Guy"](http://media.pragprog.com/articles/may_04_oo1.pdf)
* Tell Don't Ask principle
  * read the article ["Tell, Don't Ask"](http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask)
  * read the article ["The Art of Enbugging"] (http://media.pragprog.com/articles/jan_03_enbug.pdf)
