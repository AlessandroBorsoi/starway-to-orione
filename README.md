# Starway to Orione: the Orione Team Study Path

This is the study path every new dev has to follow when joins our team.

This path reflect our team's culture and values, which have its roots in the [agile values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/), as well as in those of XP, and in the [software craftmanship manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).

Please feel free to fork and contribute, add materials, fix the existing ones and propose new stuff.

## Main study path
1. [The Pomodoro Technique](study-path/pomodoro-technique) intro
2. The [Clean code](study-path/clean-code) album
3. The [Test-Driven Development](study-path/tdd) album

## Side study paths
* [Languages](study-path/languages)
* [Tools](study-path/tools)
* [Operations](study-path/operations)

## Roadmap and improvements
* How to organize all the available paths so that everyone can make up its own path?
* How should we mix the paths together?
* How should we organize all the available paths so that everyone can make up its own path?
